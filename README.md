MTA Bus ACE Enforcement Analysis

This project analyzes the impact of MTA Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) on bus speeds, violations, and rider experience using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. We leveraged data analysis libraries such as pandas and numpy to process datasets including bus route segment speeds (2023â€“2024 and 2025) and ACE violation records. The analysis examined speed changes on CUNY-heavy routes, identified high-violation hotspots and their effect on bus slowdowns, compared ACE-enforced versus non-enforced routes, evaluated the alignment between violations and speed gains, and assessed equity in enforcement benefits across boroughs. Visualizations and tables were used throughout to summarize insights and support recommendations for targeted enforcement and equitable rider improvements.
